#str
# Every sentece must be inside " ", and ' '. 
#we can use " " as we want. example: """"I am student""""


# We can put lines inside """       """ to be considered like comments.
# If we use """    """, words inside can be placed everywhere. 


#print("""I
#     am 
#    student""")

# \ backslash
# / forward slash
# \n new line


#we can use ' ' inside " " and vice verca 
#if both are written in string, we use triple quote """   """   or \'   \"

#examples

#word= 'I\'am student'
#word= """ I'm "student "  """
#word="I'am student"
#word='I"am student'


#\t -tab opens 4 character space

# to use \ inside string, we use \\
#exapmle:
path = "D:\\MAAB\\python\\Homeworks"


# or we can use r before string
path =  r"D:\MAAB\python\Homeworks"
print(path)
